# Writing Assistance

This project is a prototype for a **Context-Aware Writing Assistant**, developed as part of a learning exercise.  
It combines modern frontend and backend technologies to demonstrate how natural language processing and external APIs can be integrated into a writing support tool.

## Key Features
- Frontend built with **React and Vite**
- Backend using **FastAPI / Node.js**
- Example architecture for text processing and API integration
- Designed as a foundation for further enhancements

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Frontend Development**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend Development**: FastAPI / Node.js  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub workflow  
- **Environment Management**: Handling `.env` files and API keys securely  
- **Software Design**: Separation of frontend and backend, modular project structure  

## Status
⚠️ This repository is **archived** and will not receive further updates.  
Environment files (`.env`) and API keys have been excluded for security.

## Usage
The repository is shared for **educational and portfolio purposes** only.  
Feel free to explore the structure and adapt ideas for your own projects.
